# Tracky
![screenshot](https://github.com/Elnee/Tracky/raw/master/data/screenshots/1.png)  
GNOME Application to track your activities (WIP)

## Attention
Work is in progress. Everything can be changed (everything will be changed!) 
and you have a possibility to lost all your data in that application. Wait until a stable version released.

## Building
You can just provide link to this repo in GNOME Builder when creating a new project. Then you can simply run it.

Also you can manually build it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Elnee/Tracky.git
cd Tracky
meson builddir
cd builddir
ninja
```
